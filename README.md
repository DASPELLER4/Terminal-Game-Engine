# Terminal Game Engine
A Game Engine that is played in the terminal WIP

I started a  project to make a terminal 2D renderer, can be seen in my C-Projects repo, and with an abundance of time despite having exams soon, I decided to work on something I always wanted to make

# Controls

:q - quit
:n +
  - p - new project
  - o - new object, takes three parameters, name, colour (a single ascii character) and size (inverse, 2 is the best option)
  - s - mew script, needs to have the same name as an object
:p - preview an objecy
:o - open project
